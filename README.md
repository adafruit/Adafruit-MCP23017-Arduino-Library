This is a library for the MCP23017 I2c Port Expander
 
These chips use I2C to communicate, 2 pins required to interface

Reset pin should always be kept high, pulling it low would require a new initialization afterwards

Pin Addressing
==============

When using single pin operations such as _pinMode(pinId, dir)_ or _digitalRead(pinId)_  or _digitalWrite(pinId, val)_ then the pins are addressed using the ID's below. For example, for set the mode of _GPB0_ then use _pinMode(8, ...)_.
